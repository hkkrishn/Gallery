Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter.
Css will read the last line

.class
#id
* //get everything
element //just the tag
element, element  //we want both the h2 and p to have these properties eg h2,p
element element // we  want to select all p that innside h2 eg h2 p
element > element //I want you to select all p that have a parent h2
element + element // all sibling of h2 that are p
:hover
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)
px just pixels

em relative to rest of tag
rem relative to root element
What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order
